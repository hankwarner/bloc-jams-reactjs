# Bloc Jams

Bloc Jams is an SPA (single-page application), a music player, built from the ground up using React.js. 

## Getting Started

This app is hosted on Heroku and can be found [here](https://hankwarner-blocjams.herokuapp.com/ "Bloc Jams Homepage").


### View Album Library

Click the 'Library' link in the navigation bar to view the album library. Bloc Jams currently consists of only two albums and is currently accepting new artists!


### Listen to an Album

From the Library, click the album name or image to view and play songs. On the album's page, basic artist information is displayed on the left under the album cover, and the songlist to the right.

To play a song, hover over it in the songlist and click the play icon. Alternatively, use the player bar at the bottom to start with the first song on the album. Additionally, use the player bar to skip songs, fast-forward/rewind, and control volume.
